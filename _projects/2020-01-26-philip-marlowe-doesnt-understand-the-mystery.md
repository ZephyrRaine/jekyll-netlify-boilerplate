      atmospherically digital exploration space for the things, that happen

It's been a long night, and it's only going to get longer. Philip Marlowe doesn't understand the mystery.  
  
A short abstract neo-noir experience about confusion, memory, driving, mysteries, cats, and Raymond Chandler's classic The Long Goodbye.
