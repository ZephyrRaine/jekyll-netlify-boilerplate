      It is rare that a game which uses words and simple, filtered imagery can
      make me both shudder and relax within the same sitting, but Sand
      Gardeners’ manner of writing, and use of perception, certainly achieves
      that.

      The deliberately mundane vessel of old, late-night hotel television is
      elevated by parodical wit and the elements of novelty and surprise.

      Se basant sur divers témoignages retrouvées sur des tablettes anciennes,
      Between Stations se veut une reconstitution fidèle de cette télévision, de
      cette « télé » comme disaient les anciens, de cette époque où il neigeait
      tous les jours entre les stations.

      Between Stations catches this scenario perfectly and is also such an
      amazing narrative experience, that I really hope that you will play it.

You can't remember what time it is, but you know it is late. you have just checked into your room at the Brownie Cove Hotel. the bed is lumpy and you can't sleep, but the tv is tempting...  
﻿
For Feral Vector 2019 and the EGX 2018 Leftfield Collection we exhibited the game in an installation format with tactile tuning dials and real CRT eye-strain.
