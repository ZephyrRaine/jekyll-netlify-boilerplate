      [T]he only memory I take away is a lonely drive through a remorseless,
      unrelenting darkness, unsure if there was anything out there at all.

It is a time of war.  
  
The RESISTANCE is dwindling, and the last remaining members take refuge in an abandoned power station in the heart of the EXHAUSTLANDS.  
  
The FASCIST army moves closer everyday - unstoppable and hungry.  
  
Under the cold BROWNIE COVE sun, members of the Resistance journey out into the lands to explore the area, and prepare to do battle with the approaching DARKNESS.  
  
Space is running out, time is running out, faith is running out. But they can do this. 
  
At the EGX Rezzed Leftfield Collection 2019 we showed a collaborative version of Exhaustlands. Players worked together on the same virtual and physical map, adding their discoveries and progress, leaving hints for future adventurers, or making anonymous mistakes, impacting future success silently along the road. Each player would also have to grapple with the playfully hellish controller made from a child's toy wheel.
