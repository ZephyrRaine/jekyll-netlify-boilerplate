      The game’s airport is an over-saturated dreamscape, one that aptly
      simulates the languid, draining pace of airport life as travelers slowly
      cook under sickly fluorescent lights.

      That’s the funny part, because, ultimately, Brownie Cove is a piece with
      beautiful visuals, inoffensive and easy on the eyes, just like the catchy
      muzak the announcer keeps interrupting.

      At first it’s nice to have time to potter around, to grab a snack and
      check out the airport’s graveyard or petting zoo with ambulant hoverfish,
      but eventually… the drudgery of waiting hits.
