subtitle: Granite holds echoes of trauma.
title: Some Excavated Wounds
content: "<!--StartFragment-->\n\n![](/images/swe4.jpg)\n\n**A labour sim. Content warning for dark themes, and flashing lights.**\n\n<a href=\"https://sandgardeners.itch.io/some-excavated-ruins\" class=\"button button--large\">Itch.io</a>\n\nDevon, England, is a root site of deep cultural trauma; the legacy of colonialism, slavery, and the systematic exploitation of workers and the land. You could say the whole place has been built on top of this exploitation, tunnels wound the landscape, many uncharted, unknown, and harbouring dark secrets.\n\nIn geological time, the Devonian period was the time in which granite was formed by molten rock.\n\nGranite was mined in Devon and used to construct Dartmoor prison by French and American prisoners of war. The prison has not renewed its funding contract with the government and is pending closure.\n\nThe Stone Tape Theory is a way to explain hauntings: the energy present in moments of trauma is so great that it is absorbed by the surrounding rock... recorded like tape... awaiting playback under certain circumstances...\n\nWhat do we use to record trauma and play it back? What memories of enslavement do these objects harbour?\n\n\n> â€œThe confrontation is energy draining after all, but necessary for the healing process. Even when we are just staring in the void at the end.\" - [Sebastian Standke](https://game-curator.com/jams/ludum-dare-45-some-excavated-wounds/)\n\n\n<div class=\"gallery\" data-columns=\"3\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/swe1.jpg\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/swe2.jpg\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/swe3.jpg\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/swe4.jpg\">\n</div>\n\n[*Gameplay video by Sebastian Standke*](https://game-curator.com)\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xGKUHb0gl1M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"
