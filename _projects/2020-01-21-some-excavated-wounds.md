Devon, England, is a root site of deep cultural trauma; the legacy of colonialism, slavery, and the systematic exploitation of workers and the land. You could say the whole place has been built on top of this exploitation, tunnels wound the landscape, many uncharted, unknown, and harbouring dark secrets.

In geological time, the Devonian period was the time in which granite was formed by molten rock.

Granite was mined in Devon and used to construct Dartmoor prison by French and American prisoners of war. The prison has not renewed its funding contract with the government and is pending closure.

The Stone Tape Theory is a way to explain hauntings: the energy present in moments of trauma is so great that it is absorbed by the surrounding rock... recorded like tape... awaiting playback under certain circumstances...

What do we use to record trauma and play it back? What memories of enslavement do these objects harbour?
