3. Image gradients
4. Function of gradients, magnitude and orientation

## 01 - Gradient of functions in 1D and 2D. 
In computer vision, we tend to describe images as surfaces where the surface height is proportional to the pixel grey value (dark = low, light = high). 
For 1D functions, the gradient at $X_0$ is slope of tangent line to curve at point $X_0$.
For 2D functions, the gradient is vector of partial derivatives with respect to x and y axes. And the vector itself indicates direction and steepness of ascent.  -->
